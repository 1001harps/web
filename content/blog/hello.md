I thought I'd make a dev diary blog so then I thought I would make a little
static site generator for that, but then I needed a way to convert Markdown to
HTML, so then I made a scrappy little Markdown parser that can generate HTML,
(it can even do **bold** and _italic_ wow) so I could finish making the page
generator, and anyway here I am and [here's](https://github.com/1001harps/web/)
the source code.
